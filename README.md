# _EPICODUS STUDENT PROJECT | BDD Practice: Build a Roman Numeral Converter_

#### _Roman Numeral Converter, June 9, 2016_

#### By _**Sky Rousse, Maldon Meehan, Epicodus**_

## Description

_This is an Epicodus student project creating a web page that uses front-end user interface logic to gather number and translate them into to Roman Numerals (using back-end logic). This is an lesson in Behavior Driven Development (BDD) to learn to code using just the least amount of clean code to establish true and false booleans based on expected outputs based on potential user inputs._

Behavior  | Input Example | Output Example
------------- | ------------- | -------------
Restrict input to positive numbers only  | The13 (or) -1  | Alert: input field will only accept positive numbers
Numbers greater than 3999 not accepted| 4000  | alert: numbers cannot be greater than 3999
Restrict input to positive numbers only  | The13 (or) -1  | Alert: input field will only accept positive numbers
Assign Roman Numeral symbols to numbers (1,4,5,9,10,40,50,90,100,400,500,900,1000)| 1 | I
Output the converted number in roman-numerals | 25 | XXV
